# Estimators

Estimator classes provide an `sklearn`-like API to fit, predict and update models with the accordingly named methods. `ondil` provides a variety of estimators for different tasks, including linear regression, regularized regression, and distributional regression. These estimators are designed to handle online learning scenarios, allowing for efficient updates as new data arrives. The following sections provide an overview of the available estimators in `ondil`. We first cover the linear models, followed by distributional regression models.
